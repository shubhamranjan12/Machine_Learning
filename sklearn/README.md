The machine learning model uses Random Forest classifier,
On a heart disease data set.
n_estimator parameter is tweaked for best performance. 

-> Initially the model uses n_estimators as 100.
   which is 85.2 % accurate on test set.

-> The model's prediction is increased to 88.5 by finding out the best
   estimator which is at 120.
